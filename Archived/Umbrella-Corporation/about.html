      The Umbrella Corporation was an American multinational conglomerate with
      subsidiaries active in a variety of industries from the 1980s to the early 2000s.
      Umbrella had influence in the production and sale of cosmetics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
      industrial machine production, consumer products, health foods, the transportation industry and tourism.
      Umbrella's large array of subsidiaries was typical for large-scale corporations,
      though it was purposely built to cover up illegal activities.</i></big></div><br>
